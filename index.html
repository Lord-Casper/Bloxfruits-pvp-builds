        <div class="build">
            <h2>1. E-Claw Rumble Yama Kabucha</h2>
            <p>This build is quite versatile with great potential in both air and ground-based PvP. Adding cyborg makes it overpowered. The stats you need are Melee, Defense, and Sword. There are many one-shot combos with this build, making it good for dealing with teamers, runners, and air campers.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="build">
            <h2>2. Superhuman Rumble Soul Cane Acidum Rifle</h2>
            <p>This build works well with cyborg, and is made specifically for 1v1s, making it perfect for bounty hunting when there is only one opponent. It excels in both land and air combat. The Acidum Rifle moves are easy to hit, making the combos easy to execute. You can obtain this build in the 2nd sea, and it can fence a 30 million bounty quite fairly.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="build">
            <h2>3. Superhuman/Godhuman Gravity Kabucha Gravity Cane</h2>
            <p>This build is similar to the ice build but requires more skill and can be more effective if performed correctly. Its effectiveness depends on the user’s skill, making it either a great threat or nothing to worry about.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="build">
            <h2>4. Superhuman/Godhuman Spirit Spikey Trident Soul Guitar/Kabucha</h2>
            <p>This build depends heavily on the user's experience due to its extensive list of combos that are effective but difficult to land. With enough skill, you can become a true "Raging Demon."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="build">
            <h2>5. E-Claw Rumble Bisento-v2/Spikey Trident Kabucha</h2>
            <p>This build is special because it is both easy to hit and deals significant damage. It can one-shot a 30 million bounty, as per my experience. This build is underrated by many but has helped many players reach 30 million bounty with ease.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="build">
            <h2>6. Death Step Phoenix Dark Blade</h2>
            <p>This build offers excellent mobility and healing capabilities, making it ideal for sustained combat. The combination of Death Step's damage and Phoenix's healing allows for prolonged engagements.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="build">
            <h2>7. Sharkman Karate Magma Kabucha</h2>
            <p>This build excels in dealing area damage and crowd control. Sharkman Karate provides powerful close-range attacks, while Magma adds high damage over time. Ideal for taking on multiple opponents.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="build">
            <h2>8. Dragon Talon Flame Soul Guitar</h2>
            <p>A highly aggressive build that focuses on burst damage and quick kills. Dragon Talon's high damage output combined with Flame's crowd control abilities can quickly overwhelm opponents.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="build">
            <h2>9. Electric Claw Buddha Spikey Trident</h2>
            <p>This build is tanky and can absorb a lot of damage while dishing out powerful counterattacks. Buddha's transformation increases defense and attack range, making it hard for enemies to approach.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="build">
            <h2>10. Cyborg Fishman Karate Soul Cane</h2>
            <p>A balanced build with a focus on defense and utility. Cyborg's energy shield reduces incoming damage, while Fishman Karate and Soul Cane provide reliable damage and crowd control.</p>
